  /models/basket.js
  * Could we combine retrieveFoodsFromDatabase and saveFoodItemToDatabase?
  *

when we delete a food from basket should destroy method belong with Foods Controller or BasketFoods Controller?
basketfoods <---

Are there code where we could use user.basket_foods.all or Foods.where(user_id: user.id, food_id: food.id)

Refactoring chart in users_controller.rb

when you delete a goal, it should delete from tab via ajax
update naming of oldfoodList to customevent? haha

need a logo.

When you delete a track and immediately add another track, a track looses a chart.

When you add a food after you've deleted immediately
  doesnt happen if you do a search inbetween
